# Contributing to GitHub Actions Generator

## 🚨 Repository Status: DEPRECATED

This repository is **deprecated** and in **maintenance-only mode**.

### What This Means

- **No new features** will be accepted
- **No enhancements** will be implemented
- **Only critical security patches** for Liquibase 4.x compatibility will be considered
- All users should migrate to [`liquibase/setup-liquibase`](https://github.com/liquibase/setup-liquibase)

### Migration Path

If you're looking to contribute to Liquibase GitHub Actions support, please contribute to the official unified action:

**👉 [liquibase/setup-liquibase](https://github.com/liquibase/setup-liquibase)**

This is the actively maintained, official GitHub Action for Liquibase 4.32.0+ and all future versions.

### Security Issues

If you discover a critical security vulnerability affecting Liquibase 4.x users:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email: infosec@liquibase.com
3. Include details about the vulnerability and affected versions

### Historical Context

This repository generated individual micro-actions for each Liquibase command. These have been superseded by the unified `setup-liquibase` action which provides a better user experience and simpler maintenance.

Thank you for your interest in Liquibase!
